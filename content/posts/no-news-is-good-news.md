# No News is Good News

The last update here in the blog is already from last year. Fear not, the
project is being maintained, growing and undergoing minor bug fixes. There are
some technical things I want to refactor to improve the load time when you have
a lot of data and a fix for a small nuisance, in some cases, when the dashboard
gets updated while being watched.

I am also thinking in moving to [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) as the
current hosting provider ([Linode](https://www.linode.com/)) got bought up by
another company. With [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) we can use the ARM
CPU architecture which should actually be more power saving. The server
location would still be Germany.

The subscriptions are growing, now with 85 Euros MRR. The expenses can be paid
off and I am happy to put in more time. Thank you so much for the
contributions and motivation.

Cheers.
